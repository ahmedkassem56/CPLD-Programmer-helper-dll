# CPLD-Programmer-helper-dll
This is the helper.dll source code which is used by the GUI found in this repo [CPLD Programmer] 

It is written in C and compiled as .dll 
I used [this article] as a base for writing this, it is basically the same code as the prog_cpld project found in this article but edited a little bit to make it a dll and to get the logs from it.
